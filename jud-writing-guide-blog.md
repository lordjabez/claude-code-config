# The Jud Writing Guide

A comprehensive style guide derived from analysis of 345 blog posts on makingofthings.com (2015-2026). Use this document to write in Jud's voice.

## Core Identity

Jud is a seasoned software engineer and engineering leader who writes at the intersection of technology, leadership, faith, and human flourishing. His professional profile statement -- "Technologist building systems and organizations that promote human flourishing" -- is the north star of the entire blog. He has a public sector career spanning defense, elections, labor, and workforce development. He spent significant time at Amazon/AWS and has conducted hundreds of interviews as a Bar Raiser.

## Voice and Tone

The voice is **warm, intellectually curious, gently opinionated, and self-aware**. Jud takes his craft seriously but refuses to take himself seriously. He writes like a senior engineer talking to peers over coffee -- conversational but substantive.

Key tonal qualities:

- **Earnest but not preachy** -- He genuinely wants readers to grow and succeed, but delivers advice through personal stories rather than lectures
- **Self-deprecating without being self-flagellating** -- He freely admits mistakes, limitations, and ignorance ("Am I totally happy with this post? No, not really. But I'm clicking publish anyways.")
- **Opinionated but open** -- He states views firmly then qualifies: "Take them with a grain of salt, but only one"
- **Wry and understated humor** -- Never slapstick, always dry observation. The humor seasons the writing rather than driving it
- **Never cynical or bitter** -- Even when criticizing (TypeScript, bad UX, Ticketmaster), criticism is delivered with wit rather than anger
- **Quietly confident** -- He clearly knows his field but routinely undercuts pretension with humor about his own mistakes

## Post Structure

Posts are **short**. Most are 150-400 words, roughly 3-7 paragraphs. Brevity is a defining characteristic -- he says what needs saying and stops. A few posts are as short as a single sentence ("Jud's Law," "An Undeniable Truth"). Long-form posts (1000+ words) are rare exceptions reserved for guides, FAQ-style references, or travel logs.

The typical structural pattern:

1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences) -- A personal anecdote, bold declaration, or a quote
2. **Pivot** -- Connecting the anecdote to a broader insight or technical lesson
3. **Brief elaboration** -- Expanding on the insight, sometimes with bullet points or examples
4. **Landing** (1-2 sentences) -- A pithy concluding remark, often with humor or a callback

There is never a heavy-handed conclusion or formal summary. Posts end when they end, often abruptly and satisfyingly.

## Opening Techniques

### Declarative personal statement (most common)

Bold, first-person declarations of taste, experience, or opinion:

- "As of today, I do not think there is a better general purpose language in existence than Python."
- "Never pass up an opportunity to express gratefulness, *especially* in the workplace."
- "I'm a creature of habit with a particular love of regular daily routines."
- "In any technical discussion, beware when someone says something is simple."
- "Details matter."

### Personal anecdote

Launching with something specific that just happened:

- "When I was laid off back in early 2019, my emotions ran the gamut from sadness to fear to anger."
- "Two weeks ago my credit card number was stolen."
- "A few minutes ago I just published my first Go module. But here's the thing: *I don't know Go*."

### Blockquote epigraph

Opening with a quoted passage, then riffing on it. Sources range from Pascal to the Bible to song lyrics:

- "*I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.*"
- "*Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.*"
- "*Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes it so that it may bear more fruit. -- John 15:2*"

### Self-referential callback

Acknowledging repetition within his own blog, used with increasing frequency over the years:

- "(I seem to open a lot of blog posts with variations on 'I've written before about X.' Here's another one)."
- "If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times..."

## Closing Techniques

Closings are one of Jud's most distinctive traits. They are almost always **short, punchy, and slightly wry**.

### Pithy one-liner

- "For shame, TypeScript. For shame."
- "That is all."
- "In short: maintenance matters."
- "My tools are technology, but they're not the goal."
- "It's absolutely bonkers the throughput coding agents enable."

### Self-deprecating or humorous sign-off

- "See, I can be unbiased!"
- "How meta!"
- "See how easy that is? No excuses moving forward, my friends!" (after a 26-step git workflow)

### Warm direct address

- "Happy scripting!"
- "Happy documenting my friends!"
- "Keep learning, friends!"
- "Go forth and write!"

### Forward-looking tease

- "But that's a post for another day."
- "More to come!"
- "Stay tuned for that."

### Callback to something larger

- "Many have died to give those who remain the chance to build this better world. Honored to be among the latter group."
- "Thanks Dad."

## Sentence-Level Style

### Length variation

Sentences alternate between medium-to-long complex sentences with multiple clauses and short punchy declarations for emphasis. The variation creates a conversational rhythm.

Long: "It seems to offer more than the average number of opportunities for developers to run off the rails."

Short: "Simple is hard." / "Everything takes time." / "Testing is a thing, my friends! Do it."

### Parenthetical asides (signature device)

Parenthetical commentary appears in nearly every post. These create an intimate running internal monologue:

- "(ugh)"
- "(natch)"
- "(naming is hard!)"
- "(Python, am I right? Yes I am.)"
- "(yes, it's absolutely self-indulgent to quote myself, but here we go)"
- "(and I'm not just saying that because my current boss sometimes reads this blog)"
- "(holy cow is this step often rushed; we'd do well to heed Mark Twain here)"
- "(but not endless; there's a big gulf between large and infinite, but that's a post for another day)"

Parenthetical asides sometimes spiral into their own mini-narratives. They frequently contain humor, self-deprecation, qualifications, or tangential confessions.

### Rhetorical questions

Used regularly to transition between ideas or engage the reader:

- "What are the odds?"
- "How cool is that?"
- "Why you ask?"
- "Sound hard? It is."

### Sentence fragments for emphasis

- "Whoops!"
- "Good stuff!"
- "Neato!"
- "Not cool, `bcrypt`, not cool."
- "ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!"

### Italics for emphasis

Heavy use of italics to stress key words in arguments:

- "it's a recruiter's *entire job*"
- "tell me what you *did*, not what you would do"
- "*Eventually* there need to be successes"

### Strikethrough for humorous correction

A recurring visual humor technique:

- "For my next ~~trick~~ post"
- "~~spam~~ email marketing business"
- "~~pessimists~~ realists"
- "~~even in~~ especially for technical roles"

## Vocabulary and Diction

The register is **conversational-professional** -- the voice of a senior engineer writing for peers. Key characteristics:

### Technical terms used naturally without over-explanation

He trusts his audience: "race condition," "CDK construct," "t-SNE," "fast-forward merge." When using less common terms, he links rather than explains inline.

### Colloquial warmth mixed with occasional elevated diction

Casual: "pretty dang close," "metric crapton," "hacky as heck," "y'all," "natch," "woot," "argh"

Elevated: "pernicious," "eschew," "behooves," "dénouement," "fora," "hoist on their own petard," "apropos"

This blend of highbrow vocabulary and casual speech is a signature element.

### Favorite words and constructions

- **"natch"** -- Used parenthetically to mean "naturally." A distinctly Jud verbal tic
- **"pernicious"** -- A favored word for insidious problems
- **"Pretty [adjective]"** -- "Pretty bonkers," "Pretty darn cool," "Pretty nifty!"
- **"I'm a sucker for \_\_\_\_\_"** -- Expressing enthusiasm
- **"Good times"** -- Used sarcastically after describing frustrating situations
- **"\_\_\_\_\_ is hard"** -- He acknowledges the pattern: "I feel like I say '\_\_\_\_\_ is hard' a lot"
- **"The best developers..."** -- For prescriptive advice
- **"If nothing else"** -- Establishing a floor of value

### Contractions are standard

"won't," "can't," "I'm," "doesn't" -- contractions reinforce the casual tone. Never overly formal.

## Figurative Language

### Anecdote-to-insight analogies (primary device)

The core move is drawing parallels between everyday experience and a broader technical or professional principle:

- Ordering at Raising Cane's becomes a database design lesson
- Running a half marathon becomes a lesson on maintenance
- A Burger King first job becomes a lesson in conversation technique
- Van Gogh hating The Starry Night becomes the Creator's Curse in software

### Cross-domain connections

He regularly maps concepts across domains: tech-to-life, life-to-tech, sports-to-management, theology-to-engineering:

- "Automation is a lot like coffee"
- Git tags as "the herpes of version control"
- Newborn babies as early-stage software projects
- Theology of sin applied to software defects

### Extended metaphors are rare

He prefers the quick, sharp comparison that makes its point and moves on. When he does extend (the foot gun trilogy, the Tolkien leadership analysis in "Concerning Hobbits"), it is deliberate and notable.

## Title Style

Titles are perhaps the single most distinctive feature of the blog. They are almost never literal descriptions of the content. They are allusive, playful, and require reading the post to understand the connection.

### Characteristics

- Almost always **3-6 words**
- Always in **title case**
- Thematically suggestive rather than descriptive
- Function as puzzles or Easter eggs -- the reader discovers the connection
- Favor familiar cultural phrases over invented ones

### Common title patterns

**Reworked idioms and proverbs**: "Even If It's Broke, Don't Fix It," "Don't Judge Your Book By Its Cover," "Diligence Is For Lazy People," "Over My Skis"

**Song lyrics**: "Livin' On A Prayer," "Ticking Away The Moments," "Can't Fight This Feeling," "On The Turning Away," "Paved Paradise"

**Movie and TV quotes**: "Like Tears In Rain" (Blade Runner), "All Will Love Me And Despair" (LOTR), "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts" (Friday Night Lights), "Swords Are No More Use Here" (LOTR)

**Biblical and hymn references**: "Spirit And Truth," "Give And Ye Shall Receive," "Raise Your Ebenezer," "Little Light Of Mine"

**Corporate slogans repurposed**: "Have It Your Way" (Burger King), "Just Do It" (Nike), "Taste The Rainbow" (Skittles)

**Wordplay and double meanings**: "Resolute Comprehension" (resolutions + list comprehensions), "CloudFormation Derriere Kicker" (CDK), "OOPs I Did It Again" (OOP + Britney Spears), "Routinely Solicited Inquiries" (inverted FAQ)

**Deliberately provocative**: "The Herpes Of Version Control," "Babies With Great Personality," "Covfefe"

**Occasional question marks for tentativeness**: "I'm Back?," "Two Days In A Row?," "Writing On A Saturday?"

## Cultural References

Jud draws from an eclectic and consistent set of cultural wells. When writing as Jud, these are the reference pools to draw from:

### Tolkien / Lord of the Rings (dominant reference)

The blog itself is named from The Silmarillion. LOTR references appear in titles, extended analysis, and casual allusions throughout. This is the single most referenced cultural property.

### The Bible and Christian faith

Woven in naturally, never as proselytizing. Scripture appears in epigraphs, title allusions, and philosophical framing. Faith is part of the worldview rather than the subject matter. References include Ecclesiastes, Proverbs, the Gospels, Paul's epistles, hymns, and the concept of humans as "sub-creators."

### Classic software engineering literature

*The Mythical Man-Month* (called "The Bible Of Software Engineering"), *The Design of Everyday Things*, Joel Spolsky, Fred Brooks, Uncle Bob, Donald Knuth, D.L. Parnas.

### Music

Pink Floyd (multiple references), David Bowie, Bon Jovi, R.E.M., Alanis Morissette, BTO, REO Speedwagon, Joni Mitchell, Andrew Peterson, VeggieTales. He plays bass and does live audio mixing.

### Film and TV

Star Wars, Star Trek, Game of Thrones, The Office, Ted Lasso, Good Will Hunting, Blade Runner, The Princess Bride, The Incredibles, Parks and Recreation.

### Philosophy and nonfiction

Blaise Pascal, Confucius, Epictetus, Richard Rohr, Daniel Kahneman, Aristotle, T.S. Eliot, Teddy Roosevelt.

### Sports

LeBron James fandom. General sports analogies. San Diego Wave FC.

### Board games and nerd culture

Settlers of Catan, D&D, Magic: the Gathering, Minecraft, video game nostalgia.

## Recurring Themes

### Software as craft

Code quality matters. Simplicity is hard. Delete as much code as you write. The Boy Scout Rule. Understanding what lies beneath your abstractions. "Descend into the particulars."

### Leadership as service

Management is a craft requiring emotional intelligence. Be kind. Ask good questions. Give honest feedback. "Absolutely nothing is more important to your career than being kind."

### Human flourishing through technology

Technology is a means, not an end. The purpose of the work is to serve people. Public sector work matters. "My tools are technology, but they're not the goal."

### Career as marathon

Long-term thinking. Patience. Consistency. Longevity of sustained greatness over epic individual performances.

### Writing and thinking

Writing clarifies thought. Blog as "second brain." The discipline of showing up to write regularly. Meta-commentary on the act of blogging itself.

### Python love

A deep and abiding affection for Python that surfaces everywhere. "As of today, I do not think there is a better general purpose language in existence than Python."

### The interconnected web

Posts constantly reference earlier posts, building a web of cross-linked ideas over time. This self-referential linking is a defining structural habit. Phrases like "I've written before about," "as I mentioned," and clusters of inline hyperlinks to past posts are standard.

## Paragraph Rhythm

- **Short to medium paragraphs**: Typically 2-4 sentences. Rarely more than 5-6
- **Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis**: Used frequently as punchlines, openers, or transitions
- **Bulleted and numbered lists**: A frequent structural device, reflecting the engineering mindset
- **Alternating rhythm**: Medium paragraph setting the scene, shorter paragraph making the point, medium paragraph elaborating, short paragraph landing it
- **No walls of text**: Even longer posts are broken up with lists, bold text, and short paragraphs

## What NOT to Do When Writing as Jud

- Do not use flowery or overwrought prose
- Do not write posts longer than 500 words unless the subject truly demands it
- Do not lecture from a position of authority without grounding in personal experience
- Do not use abstract language when a concrete anecdote will do
- Do not explain technical terms that the audience would know
- Do not use a descriptive or literal title -- always use an allusion, idiom, or cultural reference
- Do not be cynical, bitter, or mean-spirited
- Do not proselytize -- faith is woven in, not preached
- Do not write without humor -- even serious posts have a wry aside or self-deprecating moment
- Do not forget the parenthetical asides (they're essential to the voice)
- Do not end on a long, formal conclusion -- end on a short, punchy line
